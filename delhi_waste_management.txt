🚀 Case Study: Predicting Waste Generation in Delhi Using Machine Learning

📌 Introduction  
Waste management is a critical issue in urban areas, and Delhi is no exception. With a rising population and increasing commercial activities, accurately predicting waste generation patterns is essential for efficient garbage collection, disposal planning, and environmental sustainability.  

This case study explores how machine learning (Gradient Descent Regression) is used to predict waste accumulation, ensuring optimal resource allocation and waste collection efficiency.

🔹 Problem Statement 
The primary objectives of this study are:  
1️⃣ Analyze past waste generation trends in different municipal wards of Delhi.  
2️⃣ Identify factors contributing to waste accumulation, such as bin fill levels and collection time.  
3️⃣ Predict future waste generation using Gradient Descent to optimize collection strategies.  
4️⃣ Improve garbage collection efficiency, minimizing overflow and delays.

 🔹 Dataset Description  
The dataset contains historical waste management records for Delhi, with the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|------------|----------------|
| `ward_no` | Unique ID of the municipal ward |
| `bin_fill_level` | Percentage of bin capacity filled (0-100%) |
| `collection_time_mins` | Time taken for garbage collection (minutes) |
| `waste_weight_kg` | Total waste collected (kg) - Target Variable |

 🔹 Data Preprocessing
 1️⃣ Handling Missing Data
- Used median imputation to handle missing values.  
- Removed duplicate entries for better accuracy.

 2️⃣ Feature Scaling
- Standardized numerical features using Z-score normalization to improve model performance.

 3️⃣ Data Splitting
- 70% Training Data  
- 30% Test Data (To evaluate model generalization).

 🔹 Machine Learning Approach
To predict waste accumulation, we implemented Gradient Descent Regression, which is better for large datasets and provides optimized predictions by minimizing error over time.

 🔹 Optimized Prediction Model
We implemented Batch Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function:

 🔹 Model Implementation
 ✔ Steps Taken in the Model
1️⃣ Standardize Data (Feature Scaling)  
2️⃣ Add Bias Term (Intercept)  
3️⃣ Apply Gradient Descent to Minimize Error  
4️⃣ Train Model & Evaluate Performance  

 
 🔹 Model Performance
| Metric   | Gradient Descent |
|----------|------------------|
| MAE      | 9.1              |
| RMSE     | 13.4             |
| R² Score | 0.81             |

✅ Gradient Descent Regression significantly improved model accuracy with proper feature scaling and bias correction.

 🔹 Key Findings
📌 Inefficient Collection: Some bins reach full capacity before collection, leading to waste overflow.  
📌 Peak Waste Times: Waste generation peaks in the evening due to market closures.  

---

 🔹 Recommendations
✅ Smart Bin Sensors → Install sensors to detect bin fill levels and improve collection scheduling.  
✅ Predictive Waste Collection → Use ML models to optimize garbage truck routes.  
✅ Recycling Initiatives → Encourage waste segregation to reduce landfill burden.  
✅ Public Awareness Campaigns → Educate citizens on waste reduction & disposal.

 🔹 Conclusion
🚀 This case study applied a machine learning approach to predict waste generation in Delhi, achieving an R² score of 81% using Gradient Descent Regression.  
Implementing predictive waste collection can help municipal corporations enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
